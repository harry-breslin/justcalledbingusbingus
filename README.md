# justcalledbingusbingus
That's what we called the repo for our [Scuffathon](https://github.com/HackMelbourne/Scuffathon) project. \
The goal was to make a scuffed feedback form for [HackMelbourne](https://hack.melbourne/). \
The website is hosted [here](https://justcalledbingusbingus.vercel.app/).



## Ngl we used Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Other ones that I deleted lol

Oh if it breaks you might wanna run `npm install` to get the required dependencies cause they're not tracked in the repo.
